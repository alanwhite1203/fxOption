# fxOption
A currency option or FX option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a certain currency at a specified exchange rate on or before a specified date. Currency options are one of the most common ways for corporations, individuals or financial institutions to hedge against adverse movements in exchange rates.
